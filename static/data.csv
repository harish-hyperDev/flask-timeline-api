Hi Arthur

You used to  have Deep Freeze Enterprise on premise product with
Maintenance but you switched to DF Cloud Ultimate  which is a cloud
subscription service .

You don't need to renew the Maintenance . You will renew Deep Freeze Cloud
Ultimate, AV Cloud and MDM Cloud + TAM service.

Did I answer your question?

Subject: Re: Faronics Cloud services, license counts and early renewal-
Body:
Good morning Arthur and Dean

Received today a renewal quote request form SHI ( Mark_Brum@shi.com)  .
Glad that we know who is now your current SHI  whom we  will send you
through the renewal quote.

You will receive a  quote for a total of 1165 licences to cover 165 extra
deployment counts  on DF Cloud Ultimate and AV cloud + 100 MDM licences on
1, 3 and 5 year options with extra early renewal discounts in case you can
take advantage of it . Also we will quote you on MK's service for one more
year.

Thank you for your support and once you receive the SHI quote, please feel
free to reach out if you have any questions on the quote  or need any
revision .

Best Regards

Shaz

discount for May purchase + 1 year of Dedicated Technical Account Manager

The early renewal  discounted quote is valid until 4.30 pm May 31st. To
secure the discount we just need to receive your PO by that date and time.

Please review the quote with Arthur and let me know if you would like as
well to see the 5 year option so I can get that for you.

Subject: Re: Faronics Cloud services, license counts and early renewal-
Body:
Good morning Arthur and Dean

Received today a renewal quote request form SHI ( Mark_Brum@shi.com)  .
Glad that we know who is now your current SHI  whom we  will send you
through the renewal quote.

You will receive a  quote for a total of 1165 licences to cover 165 extra
deployment counts  on DF Cloud Ultimate and AV cloud + 100 MDM licences on
1, 3 and 5 year options with extra early renewal discounts in case you can
take advantage of it . Also we will quote you on MK's service for one more
year.

Thank you for your support and once you receive the SHI quote, please feel
free to reach out if you have any questions on the quote  or need any
revision .

Best Regards

Subject: Re: Faronics Cloud services license counts - June 21-2023 & SHI Rep
Body:
Hi Arthur and Dean

Hope you are doing well. Just called and left you my contact info.

Is your SHI rep still  Jovon_Warren@shi.com so we can prepare a renewal
quote for you and send it to you through him/SHI?

Also you have 1000 DF Cloud Ultimate, 1000 AV Cloud with 100 MDM Cloud
licenses. However you have deployed some of the Ultimate services and AV
in more than 1000 devices.  (please see attached the snapshot)

Should we prepare a quote for you for 1160 or 1200 licenses year?

Thank you for your support.

Best Regards

Shaz

Subject: Re: Faronics Cloud services license counts - June 21-2023 & SHI Rep
Body:
Hi Arthur and Dean

Hope you are doing well. Just called and left you my contact info.

Is your SHI rep still  Jovon_Warren@shi.com so we can prepare a renewal
quote for you and send it to you through him/SHI?

Also you have 1000 DF Cloud Ultimate, 1000 AV Cloud with 100 MDM Cloud
licenses. However you have deployed some of the Ultimate services and AV
in more than 1000 devices.  (please see attached the snapshot)

Should we prepare a quote for you for 1160 or 1200 licenses year?

Thank you for your support.

Best Regards

Shaz

Good morning Nikki and Arthur

We haven't received your Deep Freeze Cloud Ultimate, AV Cloud and MDM
Cloud + TAM
( Dedicated Technical Account Manager service ) renewal order yet and May
31st is the deadline to take advantage of the early renewal discount that
we have offered you.

Please see attached a copy of the direct quote that was sent out to Nikki
on  1 and 3 year options  . Quote is valid until  May 31st.

Also two of our partners provided you with quotes too.

Where are you at decision and order processing? What is your PO status? How
can we assist you?

To secure the discount we need to receive your PO directly by max 4.30 pm
PST May 31st or to send your PO through one of our partners ( SHI or
 Technology Integration Group) by May 30th so we can receive Faronics PO on
time by May 31st for order processing.

Look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Attachment: Hawaii State Public Library System_Direct- DF Cloud Ultimate  Revised Quote- May purchase.pdf

Subject: Re: Renewal for Deep Freeze- early renewal discount- May 31st- deadline
Body:
Good morning Nikki and Arthur

We haven't received your Deep Freeze Cloud Ultimate, AV Cloud and MDM
Cloud + TAM
( Dedicated Technical Account Manager service ) renewal order yet and May
31st is the deadline to take advantage of the early renewal discount that
we have offered you.

Please see attached a copy of the direct quote that was sent out to Nikki
on  1 and 3 year options  . Quote is valid until  May 31st.

Also two of our partners provided you with quotes too.

Where are you at decision and order processing? What is your PO status? How
can we assist you?

To secure the discount we need to receive your PO directly by max 4.30 pm
PST May 31st or to send your PO through one of our partners ( SHI or
 Technology Integration Group) by May 30th so we can receive Faronics PO on
time by May 31st for order processing.

Look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Subject: Re: Faronics Cloud services, license counts and early renewal-
Body:
Good morning Arthur and Dean

Received today a renewal quote request form SHI ( Mark_Brum@shi.com)  .
Glad that we know who is now your current SHI  whom we  will send you
through the renewal quote.

You will receive a  quote for a total of 1165 licences to cover 165 extra
deployment counts  on DF Cloud Ultimate and AV cloud + 100 MDM licences on
1, 3 and 5 year options with extra early renewal discounts in case you can
take advantage of it . Also we will quote you on MK's service for one more
year.

Thank you for your support and once you receive the SHI quote, please feel
free to reach out if you have any questions on the quote  or need any
revision .

Best Regards

Shaz

Subject: Re: Faronics Discounted Quote- May purchase
Body:
Thank you for the quick reply Nicole!

Please see attached a quote on 1 and 3 year options for  1000 Deep Freeze
Cloud Ultimate + 1000 Faronics AV Cloud + 100 MDM Cloud with early renewal
discount for May purchase + 1 year of Dedicated Technical Account Manager
service.

The early renewal  discounted quote is valid until 4.30 pm May 31st. To
secure the discount we just need to receive your PO by that date and time.

Please review the quote with Arthur and let me know if you would like as
well to see the 5 year option so I can get that for you.

Attachment: Hawaii State Public Library System- DF Cloud Ultimate Direct Quote- May Purchase.pdf

Subject: Re: Faronics Discounted Quote- May purchase
Body:
Thank you for the quick reply Nicole!

Please see attached a quote on 1 and 3 year options for  1000 Deep Freeze
Cloud Ultimate + 1000 Faronics AV Cloud + 100 MDM Cloud with early renewal
discount for May purchase + 1 year of Dedicated Technical Account Manager
service.

The early renewal  discounted quote is valid until 4.30 pm May 31st. To
secure the discount we just need to receive your PO by that date and time.

Please review the quote with Arthur and let me know if you would like as
well to see the 5 year option so I can get that for you.

Subject: Re: Faronics Cloud services, license counts and early renewal-
Body:
Good morning Arthur and Dean

Received today a renewal quote request form SHI ( Mark_Brum@shi.com)  .
Glad that we know who is now your current SHI  whom we  will send you
through the renewal quote.

You will receive a  quote for a total of 1165 licences to cover 165 extra
deployment counts  on DF Cloud Ultimate and AV cloud + 100 MDM licences on
1, 3 and 5 year options with extra early renewal discounts in case you can
take advantage of it . Also we will quote you on MK's service for one more
year.

Thank you for your support and once you receive the SHI quote, please feel
free to reach out if you have any questions on the quote  or need any
revision .

Best Regards

Shaz

Subject: Re: Faronics Cloud services license counts - June 21-2023 & SHI Rep
Body:
Hi Arthur and Dean

Hope you are doing well. Just called and left you my contact info.

Is your SHI rep still  Jovon_Warren@shi.com so we can prepare a renewal
quote for you and send it to you through him/SHI?

Also you have 1000 DF Cloud Ultimate, 1000 AV Cloud with 100 MDM Cloud
licenses. However you have deployed some of the Ultimate services and AV
in more than 1000 devices.  (please see attached the snapshot)

Should we prepare a quote for you for 1160 or 1200 licenses year?

Thank you for your support.

Best Regards

Shaz

Attachment: Deployment counts -HSPLS.PNG

Subject: Re: Faronics Cloud services license counts - June 21-2023 & SHI Rep
Body:
Hi Arthur and Dean

Hope you are doing well. Just called and left you my contact info.

Is your SHI rep still  Jovon_Warren@shi.com so we can prepare a renewal
quote for you and send it to you through him/SHI?

Also you have 1000 DF Cloud Ultimate, 1000 AV Cloud with 100 MDM Cloud
licenses. However you have deployed some of the Ultimate services and AV
in more than 1000 devices.  (please see attached the snapshot)

Should we prepare a quote for you for 1160 or 1200 licenses year?

Thank you for your support.

Best Regards

Shaz
